# Todo list

- packaging from src dir (git/darcs)
- prefer installed deps
- do not assume %ghc_fix_dynamic_rpath executable is %name
- warn about missing dependencies/versions
- run "cabal update" if no ~/.cabal/
- do not override _rpmdir, _srcrpmdir, _sourcedir ?
- include README.*
- add comment about no debuginfo?

## summary/description
- remove \ and @ from descriptions (eg \"text\" and @Module.Name@)
- first letter of summary and description should be a capital
- filter or blockformat literate code in description ("> ...")

## other
- support templates, eg for other distros

# Commands
- allow commands without arg: "cblrpm srpm" etc
  - or cblrpm [srpm|build] pkg.spec ?
- command-based flags

## prep

## build
- support "cblrpm build" in pkg git dir when version old
  (can probably be covered by above no arg rfe)

## install
- recursive rpm building of missing depends
- maybe packaging of stacks into one deployable rpm
  - build --selfcontained rpms

## update
- updating of spec files: initially BRs
- "cblrpm update" to update to a new version
- "URM" support - ie check/warn about latest version
- include version ranges in BRs
- reverse deps and rebuilds

## mock
- support mock builds and mockchain

## builddep
- for development allow installing .cabal depends
