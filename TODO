- bring back building
- recursive rpm building of missing depends
- installation of already packaged depends (cf yum-builddep)
- updating of spec files: initially BRs
- maybe packaging of stacks into one deployable rpm
- support mock builds
- conventional --version output
- prefer installed deps
- get VERSION in Makefile

- make sure description has closing fullstop

- use "rpm -qf" to map deps to packages
- sort BRs

- rename executable to cblrpm
- check 'cabal' installed before using it
