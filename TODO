- packaging from src dir (git/darcs)
- updating of spec files: initially BRs
- support mock builds
- prefer installed deps
- install ghc-rpm-macros, rpmbuild and cabal-install

- check 'cabal' installed before using it

- use "rpm -qf" to map deps to packages
- sort all BRs

- add %ghc_fix_dynamic_rpath if executable depends on own lib

- print missing dependencies/versions
- option to include version range in BRs

- "cblrpm build" should warn when .spec exists

# yum install
- query about installing deps with yum and then use -y
- check yum available before yum install
- warn about unmet package versions

# recursion
- recursive rpm building of missing depends
- maybe packaging of stacks into one deployable rpm
  - build --selfcontained rpms
