# Todo list

## Bugs
* improve "business logic"
  - eg: if spec exists but no dir/tarball then need to fetch source and prep before missingdeps
    - testcase: latest git-annex or hakyll
  - store/accumulate state?

## Misc
* run "cabal update" if no ~/.cabal/
- do not override _rpmdir, _srcrpmdir, _sourcedir ?
- support pkg.buildinfo
- allow .cabal~ or override option for file extension check

- unify hackage and package deps into a common record structure
  with pkgShow and depShow to render strings
  * add RpmPackage and use Dependency
- use withTempDirectory?

# Commands
- fetch

## Options
- command-based flags and help

## spec/packaging
- do not assume %ghc_fix_dynamic_rpath executable is %name
- support templates, eg for other distros
- filter or blockformat literate code in description ("> ...")
- sort devel packages ignoring -devel suffix?
* common subpackage for binlib packages
- include README.*
- --legacy for RHEL5 rpm
- handle datafiles more automatically
  - clean away READMEs etc
- include version ranges in BRs
- use repoquery for missing testdeps
* label missing deps with comment

## version ranges
- warn about missing dependencies/versions

## standalone
- packaging of lib stacks into one deployable rpm
* support creating and building standalone package including its missing deps
  - phase 1: cabal-dev
  - phase 2: embed src tarballs of missing deps

## local
- --no-network
- llvm flag
- running "cblrpm local pkg" in pkg/ with existing pkg.spec when newer pkg exists builds old pkg (or "cbl local pkg-ver")

## install
- recursive rpm building of missing depends

## update
- update of BRs
- update to a new version
- "URM" support - ie check/warn about latest version
- reverse deps and rebuilds

## depends
- dependency graphs or sorted recursive deps
- reverse dependencies
- using repoquery for uninstalled missingdeps
- use rpmspec when available?  (Centos5/6 too old)

## koji/buildsys
- support mock builds and mockchain
- support rebuilding reverse deps
- chain-build
- copr support?
- scratch builds

## diff
- filter %changelog
- ignore whitespace option

# Minor
