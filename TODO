# Todo list

* run "cabal update" if no ~/.cabal/
- do not override _rpmdir, _srcrpmdir, _sourcedir ?
- support pkg.buildinfo
- allow .cabal~ or override option for file extension check

# Commands
- allow pkg.spec arg?
* determine pkg name from spec file in current dir

## Options
- command-based flags
- better option processing: per command, anywhere, etc

## spec/packaging
* if ghc-PKGNAME.spec exists, don't assume binlib package
- do not assume %ghc_fix_dynamic_rpath executable is %name
- support templates, eg for other distros
- filter or blockformat literate code in description ("> ...")
* "%global debug_package %{nil}" when no c-sources [Fedora 21]
- sort devel packages ignoring -devel suffix?
* common subpackage for binlib packages
- include README.*

## version ranges
? prefer installed deps
- warn about missing dependencies/versions

## standalone
- packaging of lib stacks into one deployable rpm
* support creating and building standalone package including its missing deps
  - phase 1: cabal-dev
  - phase 2: embed src tarballs of missing deps

## rpm
* support "cblrpm rpm" in pkg git dir when not latest version
  (can probably be covered by using current spec file)
- build alias for rpm command?
- --no-network
- use llvm flag

## install
- recursive rpm building of missing depends
* use repoquery to check existence of missing deps before attempting yum install

## update
- update of BRs
- update to a new version
- "URM" support - ie check/warn about latest version
- include version ranges in BRs
- reverse deps and rebuilds
* running "cblrpm rpm pkg" in pkg/ with existing pkg.spec when newer pkg exists still builds old pkg

## depends
- dependency graphs or sorted recursive deps
- reverse dependencies

## koji/buildsys
- support mock builds and mockchain
- support rebuilding reverse deps
- chain-build
- copr support?
