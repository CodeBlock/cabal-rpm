# Todo list

- prefer installed deps
- do not assume %ghc_fix_dynamic_rpath executable is %name
- warn about missing dependencies/versions
* run "cabal update" if no ~/.cabal/
- do not override _rpmdir, _srcrpmdir, _sourcedir ?
- include README.*
* "%global debug_package %{nil}" when no c-sources [Fedora 21]
- sort devel packages ignoring -devel suffix?
* common subpackage for binlib packages
- support pkg.buildinfo

- --no-network option?
- allow .cabal~ or override option for file extension check
* running "cblrpm rpm pkg" in pkg/ with existing pkg.spec when newer pkg exists still builds old pkg

- build alias for rpm command
- if ghc-PKGNAME.spec exists, don't assume binlib package
- copr support?

## summary/description
- remove \ and @ from descriptions (eg \"text\" and @Module.Name@)
- first letter of summary and description should be a capital
- filter or blockformat literate code in description ("> ...")

## other
- support templates, eg for other distros

# Commands
- allow pkg.spec arg?
- determine pkg name from spec file in current dir
- command-based flags
- better option processing: per command, anywhere, etc

## prep

## rpm
* support "cblrpm rpm" in pkg git dir when version old
  (can probably be covered by using current spec file)
- maybe packaging of stacks into one deployable rpm
  - build --selfcontained rpms
- copy tarball before building

## install
- recursive rpm building of missing depends
* use repoquery to check existence of missing deps before attempting yum install

## update
- update of BRs
- update to a new version
- "URM" support - ie check/warn about latest version
- include version ranges in BRs
- reverse deps and rebuilds

## mockbuild
- support mock builds and mockchain

## builddep
- for development allow installing .cabal depends

## depends
- output dependencies for a package
- dependency graphs or sorted recursive deps
- reverse dependencies

## koji/build
- support rebuilding reverse deps
- chain-build
