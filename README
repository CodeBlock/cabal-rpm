The cabal-rpm package lets you build an RPM package from a
Cabal-format Haskell package, such as you might download from the
HackageDB archive.  Haskell compilers include their own language-level
package databases; cabal-rpm manages your compiler's package database
automatically.

Building
--------

I've tested cabal-rpm with GHC 6.8.2 on Fedora 8.  It should work "out
of the box".

If you're using a GHC release older than 6.8, you'll need to build and
install version 1.2.3 of Cabal:

http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/Cabal-1.2.3.0

Once it's built, you can build cabal-rpm in the usual way.


Usage
-----

Before you continue, make sure you have the rpmbuild RPM package
installed.

To use cabal-rpm, simply unpack a Cabal tarball, cd into the directory
it creates, and run cabal-rpm there.  This will build RPM packages for
you.  It won't install the packages; that's up to you.
